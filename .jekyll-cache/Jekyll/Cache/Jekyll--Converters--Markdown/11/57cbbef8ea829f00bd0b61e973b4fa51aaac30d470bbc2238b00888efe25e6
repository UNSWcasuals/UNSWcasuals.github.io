I"˜<p>The UNSW Casuals Network rejects the rationale offered to us by the university for its proposed restructures and job cuts. Instead of supporting students and workers in our struggle against government defunding, UNSW leadership are choosing once again to impose the costs of uncertainty on those who are least able to bear it. We speak here particularly of those students and workers â€” academic, professional, or otherwise â€” whose limited options in this moment are the product of decades worth of â€˜economic rationalismâ€™ and centuries worth of slavery and colonisation. These measures are not necessary. They are a function of power and domination.</p>
