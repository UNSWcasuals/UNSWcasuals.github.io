  <p>This meeting of the UNSW Casuals Network stands in solidarity with LGBTQI+ communities. It is our responsibility to call out transphobic, homophobic, sexist and other exclusionary behaviour in our activist spaces. We condemn the transphobic statements of Virginia Mansel-Lees, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ds1KuZOCzutSVhTRBfRxfVM8JV7BUc7Py135qAFrYWY/">endorse the following open letter</a> calling for Virginia’s removal as Convener of the NTEU’s Queer Unionists in Tertiary Education (QUTE) network. We will also email this motion to the NTEU National, NSW, Victorian and UNSW branch presidents. Transgender rights are union business.</p>
