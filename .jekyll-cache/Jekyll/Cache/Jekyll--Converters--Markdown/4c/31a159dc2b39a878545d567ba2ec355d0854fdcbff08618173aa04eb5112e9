I"|<p>Last week, we released the results of a survey conducted in April of casual staff at UNSW. The report includes some staggering but unsurprising findings: casuals are already the prime collateral as UNSW seeks to restructure work at the university in order to cut costs. We found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>1 in 3 UNSW casual workers had already lost work as a result of COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>81% fear that they will lose their job this year</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>41% are currently working unpaid hours, with one in three of these working more than 10 hours unpaid per week</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The survey shows that if we don’t assert our interests now, most of us won’t have jobs at UNSW next term. Join the UNSW Casuals Network now to fight back!</p>
