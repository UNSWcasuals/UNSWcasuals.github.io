I"ç<p>The UNSW Casuals Network has created a petition for all UNSW staff to show solidarity with precarious workers. It attempts to outline some of the situation with how precarious workers are becoming the first victims of COVID-19 cost-cutting, the value of these workers to the education system, the potential impact to student learning, and the importance of secure staff not taking voluntary concessions. Please sign and share if you would like to show solidarity with this cause.</p>
