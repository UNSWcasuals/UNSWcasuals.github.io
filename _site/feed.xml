&lt;p&gt;“University students have a proud history of supporting NTEU strikes in the past and we’re willing to fight alongside staff who reject the idea that they should sacrifice pay and conditions for the university’s profits. Instead of putting the cost of this crisis onto staff and students, universities should dip into their enormous cash reserves and investment portfolio assets to fund their revenue shortfalls, and the government should fully fund free public higher education.”&lt;/p&gt;

It attempts to outline some of the situation with how precarious workers are becoming the first victims of COVID-19 cost-cutting, the value of these workers to the education system, the potential impact to student learning, and the importance of secure staff not taking voluntary concessions.

The report includes some staggering but unsurprising findings: casuals are already the prime collateral as UNSW seeks to restructure work at the university in order to cut costs. We found that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1 in 3 UNSW casual workers had already lost work as a result of COVID-19&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;81% fear that they will lose their job this year&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;41% are currently working unpaid hours, with one in three of these working more than 10 hours unpaid per week&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey shows that if we don’t assert our interests now, most of us won’t have jobs at UNSW next term. Join the UNSW Casuals Network now to fight back!&lt;/p&gt;
