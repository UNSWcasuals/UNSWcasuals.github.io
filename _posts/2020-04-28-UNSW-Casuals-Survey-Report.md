title: "UNSW Casuals Survey Report"
---

Last week we released the results of a survey conducted in April of casual staff at UNSW. The report includes some staggering but unsurprising findings: casuals are already the prime collateral as UNSW seeks to restructure work at the university in order to cut costs. We found that:

* 1 in 3 UNSW casual workers had already lost work as a result of COVID-19

* 81% fear that they will lose their job this year

* 41% are currently working unpaid hours, with one in three of these working more than 10 hours unpaid per week

The survey shows that if we don’t assert our interests now, most of us won’t have jobs at UNSW next term. Join the UNSW Casuals Network now to fight back!
