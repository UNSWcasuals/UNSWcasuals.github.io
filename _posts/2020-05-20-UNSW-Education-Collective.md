So great to have the support of student unionists! ✊ Attacks on staff working conditions are attacks on students' learning conditions.

“University students have a proud history of supporting NTEU strikes in the past and we're willing to fight alongside staff who reject the idea that they should sacrifice pay and conditions for the university’s profits. Instead of putting the cost of this crisis onto staff and students, universities should dip into their enormous cash reserves and investment portfolio assets to fund their revenue shortfalls, and the government should fully fund free public higher education.”
