title: UNSW Casuals Network Response to Conversion Emails

THERE’S NOTHING ‘CASUAL’ ABOUT BEING PRECARIOUSLY EMPLOYED AT UNSW: STOP CASUALISATION AND UNFAIR WORK PRACTICES

We've just released our open letter in response to the recent emails about casual conversion. We demand to know: 

* What process, if any, was undertaken to assess casuals on an individual basis
* Who undertook the assessments and how they were qualified to do so
* How many casuals were affected, and of those, how many were made offers for conversion
* Why research-active casuals were not recognised
* Why casual academic staff were not evaluated against criteria for education focused roles
